# Overview

As a software engineer eager to expand my skills, I embarked on a simple project to further my learning. My project involves creating a basic Python program that displays the classic "Hello World!" message. This may seem trivial, but it serves as a fundamental step in understanding the Python programming language and the development process.

## Description

I wrote a simple program that will print `Hello World!`. I used Pyton to accomplish this task.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Gain hands-on experience with Python programming.
- Familiarize myself with the development environment and tools.
- Establish a starting point for more advanced software projects.
- Develop a strong foundation in coding principles.

# Development Environment

During the development of this project, I utilized the following tools and technologies:

- **Code Editor:** I chose Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my primary code editor due to its user-friendly interface and extensive support for Python development.

- **Programming Language:** I wrote the software in Python, a versatile and widely-used language known for its simplicity and readability. Python is an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike, making it a great language to start my journey.

- **Version Control:** I employed Git for version control, allowing me to track changes and collaborate with others seamlessly.

- **Operating System:** My development environment runs on macOS, providing a Unix-like terminal and a stable platform for Python development.

By combining these tools, I created a conducive environment for learning and coding, enabling me to explore Python and develop my skills further.
